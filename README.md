# C-Sharp-The-Ultimate-Base-Class-Object

# Everything is an Object in C Sharp.

Please read my comments in the code to understand it all working well.

Here I use the actual C Sharp programme as an Object, and join a PI metod onto it. 

This is to show you all that C# has an "Ultimate Base Class", and you "CAN" derive and inherit your new class object to use all the variables and methods from inside it to build whatever you want to in your new programme. This is awesome!

Kind regards, Mike BSc (HONS).
